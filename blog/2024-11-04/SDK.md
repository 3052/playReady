well the sdk is the playready ta
if you can get one, then you can update/upgrade the mspr toolkit
there was a windows pr leak a month ago or so. maybe you can use that ?

I mean thats not really an SDK if I am understanding you - it sounds like
you're just saying download a TA and decompile it or something

no
so the playready ta comes from the SDK, but the leaked codebase from the sdk is
called playready ta-2/3/4
its not compiled, its the source code
