extracting it from a tv usually
but even with a device, its useless without a cdm

well that's a setback - I was thinking we might be close but seems maybe we aren't even close
 â€”

nowhere near close
devices are all over github
but not initialized
and cant use them without a cdm 
and no public cdms exist

so the whole mspr_toolkit is pointless without CDM?

the mspr_toolkit was nothing useful in general
so yea its pointless

well that sucks - thanks for the info. FYI I write scripts if you need help with stuff - but it seems you are beyond my level

can I dump my own CDM like with Widevine?
 â€”

need a real device like a tv
and btw
you dont "dump" cdms
you dump devices
cdm is content decryption module like pywidevine
its used with a device you dump to decrypt content
devices themselves are not cdm
this is only true with chrome cdm as its device + cdm together

I mean OK sure I get that. I wrote my own Widevine module from scratch so I know a little about this stuff, I just go the term wrong. so possibly I could dump a PR device then use mspr_toolkit as the CDM?
 â€” 
Today at 9:17 PM
if you dump a pr device it wont be "initiliazed" and mspr_toolkit isnt a cdm

OK so what then? should I just give up? or do you have some advice what I would do next if I want to keep at it?
